## Skills Showcased


## Folder Structure
Each task has 4 folders:

There are further details of each project in the notebook/html within the analysis scripts folder.

### Task 3 - Sea bird observation data {#3}
**Data**

This project cleans, joins, and investigates data from ships in the southern hemisphere on seabird sightings.

The cleaning script:

* Selects the relevant columns and renames tham where appropriate
* Joins the data from the ships to the data on the birds
* Creates columns for year, family, and genus
* Removes unnecessary abbreviations from the bird names
* Removes entries where no birds were recorded
