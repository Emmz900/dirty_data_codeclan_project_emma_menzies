# Hallowe'en Candy Analysis

## Introduction

## Set up
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

candy_data <- read_csv(here("clean_data/candy_data_clean.csv"))
```

## What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years.
Since each row is an individual rating, and all missing ratings have been removed, the number of ratings is equivalent to the number of rows.
```{r}
num_of_ratings <- nrow(candy_data)

cat("The total number of ratings is", num_of_ratings)
```
## What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  filter(trick_or_treating == "Yes") %>% 
  summarise(age = mean(age)) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?

## For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?
